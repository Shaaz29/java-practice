## How to Use This Repository

1. Each topic has its own directory with relevant examples
2. Solutions include detailed comments explaining the approach
3. Time and space complexity analysis is provided for each solution
4. Test cases are included to verify the solutions

## Best Practices for Interview Preparation

1. **Understand the Basics**
   - Review core Java concepts
   - Practice writing clean, readable code
   - Focus on proper naming conventions

2. **Problem-Solving Approach**
   - Read and understand the problem completely
   - Consider edge cases
   - Think about optimal solutions
   - Discuss trade-offs between different approaches

3. **Time Management**
   - Practice solving problems within time constraints
   - Learn to explain your thought process while coding
   - Review and optimize solutions

## Resources

- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- GeeksforGeeks
